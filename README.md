# vk_graph_data_extractor
A python 3 crawler mainly focused on extracting links between VK communities to create Graphs. The usual output is a .csv file with nodes (crawled pages and uncovered websites) and edges (hyperlinks from one node to the other)

Data is to be further analyzed and reprojected using Gephi or D3js as force-directed graph.
